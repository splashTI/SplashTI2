        "cardDesc":"SplashTI2 is a free java application for running TM1 TI processes concurrently. It has a similar syntax to <a href='https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS9RXT_10.1.0/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.tm1_turb.10.1.0.doc/c_tm1_op_tm1runtisyntax.html'>TM1RunTI</a>, but SplashTI2 does not have a dependency on TM1RunTI. It utilizes TM1JavaAPI library. But it's not necessary to install a java on TM1 Admin Server, because it can be simply run by using java from TM1 installation directory. <br/><br/> Why to use SplashTI2 over TM1RunTI? SplashTI2 runs a group of processes where you are able to control how many processes to run simultaneously. Letâ€™s say there 24 processes are in your batch file and you have only 4 logical processors available on your server. You found the most efficient way for your TM1 instance to run 4 processes concurrently. By using SplashTI2 you are able to run 4 processes concurrently; Once a process has finished, SplashTI2 will run next from the list. To achieve this behaviour with TM1RunTI you would need create a semaphore scheme with start-stop flag files/cube cells, etc. Also SplashTI2 can terminate group of processes, what can be useful during development."
